# IoTUnivariateAnomalyDataSet


IoTUnivariateAnomalyDataSet.csv is a Pulse rate csv file that contains 1188 samples.

Pulse rate analog value  is read by Arduino Uno and a Pulse Sensor from human body.

The dataset contains some intentially fed anomalies beyond the normal analog range.

The CSV file is manipulated with three anomalies intentionally as analog raw values at data point 362, 844, and 1101

This dataset can be used for Univariate Anomaly / Outliers detection for IoT-based environment.
