# IoTUnivariateAnomalyDataSet


IoTUnivariateAnomalyDataSet.csv is a Pulse rate csv file that contains 1188 samples.

Thus, each minute has 3 pulse rate analog value from Arduino Uno and a Pulse Sensor from human body.

The dataset contains some intentially fed anomalies beyond the normal analog range.

This dataset can be used for Univariate Anomaly / Outliers detection for IoT-based environment.
